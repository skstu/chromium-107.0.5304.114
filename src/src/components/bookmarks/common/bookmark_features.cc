// precursor to and not a replacement for the real check. Does nothing if

// If enabled, uses an alternative approach to loading typed counts for URLs
// when fetching bookmark matches for the bookmark provider.
// - When disabled, for each matching bookmark, it runs 1 SQL query to look up
//   its typed count by URL, which is indexed and therefore runs O(n * log(m)),
//   where n is the # of bookmark matches, and m is the # of URLs.
// - When enabled, reads all URLs from the DB in 1 scan and stores them to a
//   `std::map`. Then for each matching bookmark, it looks up the URL in the
//   map. This is O(n*log(m) + m) runtime and requires O(m) additional space.
//   This map isn't cached since the DB changes as the user visits and deletes
//   visits; and propagating those changes to the cached map would add
//   complexity.
